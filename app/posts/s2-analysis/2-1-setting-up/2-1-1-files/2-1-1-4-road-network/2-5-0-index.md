The road network needs to be a valid [OSM XML](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_XML) file that is routable.

## File requirements

* a valid OSM XML file. To speed up the processing, provide a file that only contains the relevant roads.

A different road network can be uploaded for each scenario.
